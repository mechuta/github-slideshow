## Guitar+bass & drums duo MECHUTA 

Welcome here ! This is our almost-secret LAB to host our jam sessions ! It's all about improvisation and playing together without any cue. We just plug-in and play, sometimes the result is almost satisfying, sometimes not. We tend tio put our reheasal sessions online every time we jam together.
